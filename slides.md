Bad
========

Boss: "What is Hadoop?"

You: "Hadoop is great, I've been using for a few years and have watched the community grow over time.    Everything from the ASF is safe to use from a licensing standpoint, but I'm not lawyer.  The volunteer community is great, and I think we should contribute any changes back to Apache.   There's this CLA and CCLA form that needs to be signed, should I just get everyone to sign it?"

Worse
========

Our application uses a bunch of open source libraries.   We don't distribute anything, so don't worry about licensing or anything.  It doesn't matter.

 Breaking an Assumption

Our infrastructure relies on Apache Hadoop, a project with solid governance with multiple companies providing commercial support.   Our own engineers participate in the ongoing management of the project to ensure that
